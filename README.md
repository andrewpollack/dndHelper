dndHelper (name work in progress) is a helper for your DnD players and DMs!  For now, it can be used as a simple
dice rolling simulator, but later I hope to add many features including character creation, item creation, beastiary,
and even more.  Stay tuned, and let me know if you have any suggestions! :]
